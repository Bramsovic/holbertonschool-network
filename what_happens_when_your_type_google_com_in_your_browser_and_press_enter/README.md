## 📚 Project Overview

This project aims to demystify one of the most common but complex questions in software engineering: **"What happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter?"**. This is a classic interview question that tests a candidate's understanding of the full web stack, from DNS resolution to database queries.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- **DNS Resolution** - How the domain name is converted to an IP address
- **TCP/IP** - The transport protocols that carry data over the network
- **Firewalls** - How traffic is filtered for security
- **HTTPS/SSL** - How data is encrypted for secure communication
- **Load Balancers** - How traffic is distributed for reliability
- **Web Servers** - How server-side resources are managed
- **Application Servers** - How dynamic content is generated
- **Databases** - How persistent data is stored and retrieved
